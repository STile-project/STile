The code of STile

"preprcess_param.pt", "preprcess_param_atomic.pt", "trained_model", "trained_model_atomic" are weights of the MLP cost model.

"SDDMM_get_cost_model_1D.py", "SDDMM_get_cost_model_TC.py", "SPMM_get_cost_model_ELL.py", "SPMM_get_cost_model_TC.py" are files to get data for cost model.

"MLP_train_cost_model.py" is used to train an MLP cost model for ELL-format tiles.
